# Microbiomformer
Microbiomformer is a transformer-based model designed to analyze and interpret human gut microbiome data. This model leverages the power of deep learning to extract meaningful patterns and insights from complex microbiome datasets. The ultimate goal is to use these insights to classify different responses to immunotherapy in lung cancer, providing a robust tool for researchers and clinicians.

# Features
Transformer-based architecture: Utilizes advanced transformer models for high-performance data analysis.
Human gut microbiome focus: Specially trained on human gut microbiome datasets to capture domain-specific nuances.
Immunotherapy response classification: Integrates with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model to classify responses to lung cancer immunotherapy.
Scalable and customizable: Easily adaptable to different datasets and research needs.
